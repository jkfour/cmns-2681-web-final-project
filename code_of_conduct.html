            <h2>Code of Conduct for In Store Play</h2>
            <p>Here at Sanctuary Games we want to ensure that everyone has a good time, in a clean, fun, safe, and
                inclusive environment. Please follow these simple rules.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Put Fun First</h3>
                    <img class="left-imgs" src="media/images/conduct/smiley.jpg" alt="Smiley Face">

                    <p>Competition is a part of our games, but win or lose, we keep it friendly, respectful, and
                        fun.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Welcome Everyone</h3>
                    <p>Our community includes a range of diverse people. No matter who sits down at the table with
                        us,
                        we
                        make
                        them
                        feel welcome.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Keep it Clean</h3>
                    <img class="left-imgs" src="media/images/conduct/cleaning.jpg" alt="People Cleaning">

                    <p>We’re all caretakers of the game experience, and that includes the spaces we play in. Each of
                        us
                        should
                        help
                        maintain a clean and safe environment for all.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Be Respectful</h3>
                    <p>Please be mindful of things like language, inappropriate jokes, being overly loud, giving
                        other
                        people
                        unwanted attention, and things like that. We cater to customers of all ages, and our staff
                        is
                        just
                        as
                        diverse. What may seem appropriate or funny in your circle may not be so well received by
                        others
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>No strong odours</h3>
                    <img class="right-imgs" src="media/images/conduct/shower.jpg" alt="Fist punching water">

                    <p>This covers everything from perfume / cologne to body odours. If you are coming to use the
                        public
                        space,
                        please do not wear strong scented perfumes. It is expected that anyone coming to use our
                        space
                        practices
                        proper hygiene before arriving; showered, wearing clean, well fitted clothes, deodorant,
                        etc.
                        Nobody
                        wants
                        to shop in, or play in, a store that smells bad, so please be mindful.</p>
